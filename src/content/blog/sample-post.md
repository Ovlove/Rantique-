There’s a difference between quiet and silence.

In a world of endless pings and breaking news, silence isn’t emptiness — it’s space.  
It’s the room ideas need to breathe. It’s the echo chamber that reveals your true thoughts.

So the next time the world gets loud, take a moment. Listen to your thoughts — they’re louder than you think.
