# The Clockmaker’s Paradox

In a forgotten alley, nestled between bookshops and bakeries, lived a clockmaker named Eliot.

He wasn’t famous, but his clocks were.

People claimed Eliot’s clocks could **slow time**, **freeze memories**, even **rewrite regrets**.

Most laughed. Some believed.

But only one dared ask for more.

**Chapter I: The Man with the Broken Watch**

The man arrived soaked in rain, clutching a busted timepiece from the 1800s.

Eliot didn’t answer.

He just wound the old watch backwards.

And the past began to tick again.

More stories coming soon…
